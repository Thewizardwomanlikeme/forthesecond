Q1. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

answer1: If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, then taking the average values
of danceability, energy and valence of these songs would give us the audio aura of the listener. For example,
if the average values turns out to be high then the listener might have a taste for high energy music and like
Mystic Michaela we could make it as a swirling gradient of orange and more colours where each colour represents
a perticular mood.

Q2.Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

answer2. There are multiple other factors other than danceability, energy and valence which determine what kind
of music is preferred by a listener like the lyrics, tempo or there mood at that time of the day. By considering
a limited number of factors or data we might not identify the actuall 'aura' of the person. Also if we got an average
which was neither too high (high energy and cheerful type) nor too low (moody and sad type), then the mood of such
of songs of such a listener would become unclear.
So instaed of considering only the average values of danceability, energy and valence of the top 100 songs of the
listener, we could also take into consideration the type of lyrics each song has, the tempo and maybe even the
speechiness and thus like Mystic Michaela create the aura spectrum by assigning a color to each mood. Incase a listener listened
to songs of different moods we could assign a weight percetage for each mood and make the final product is a swirling gradient of color.
